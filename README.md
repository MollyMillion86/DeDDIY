Dungeon &amp; Dragons Do-It-Yourself

This is a project with a dual purpose: to learn (and teach) the rules of Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 and to learn web development.

It has never been completed, and probably never will happen, but I have used it to give myself many small goals to complete.
The project is open source, open to everyone, fully modifiable and customizable for educational purposes only. 
For this purpose within it are MySQL schemas for the database and an Adobe XD file with a draft of the final layout.


A much lighter version that includes only an interchangeable battle grid and customizable checkers is available [here](https://github.com/MollyMillion86/battle-grid).
